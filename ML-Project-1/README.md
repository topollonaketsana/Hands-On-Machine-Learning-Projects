### Project 1: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

In this project, we will go through the entire process of a machine learning project from start to finish. We will:

- Explore the data
- Prepare the data
- Select and train a model
- Fine-tune the model
- Present the solution

##
NOTE, some steps are not included in the above steps such as data cleaning, because, ive collected the clean data, if you want to include the data cleaning step, that is alright too.
