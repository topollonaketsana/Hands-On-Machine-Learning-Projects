### Project 1: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

In this project, we will go through the entire process of a machine learning project from start to finish. We will:

- Explore the data
- Prepare the data
- Select and train a model
- Fine-tune the model
- Present the solution

##
The accessible code is written on `Housing_src.ipynb` and can be ran using the following bash lines:

1. After cloning the main repository, you move to this sub-directory:
```bash
cd ML-Project-1
```


2. Run the code 
```bash
jupyter lab Housing_src.ipynb
