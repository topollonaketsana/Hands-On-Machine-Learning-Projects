# Machine-Learning-Projects

# Welcome to the Machine Learning (ML) repository
This repository is guided by the book called hands-on-ML [Hands-on-Machine Learning (PDF)](https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=41&q=Hands-on-Machine-Learning+(1).pdf&cvid=968805ac36bf47619def6f98aa92e581&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgYIAhBFGDzSAQgyMDA3ajBqMagCALACAA&FORM=ANNTA1&ucpdpc=UCPD&adppc=EDGEESS&PC=DCTS)
