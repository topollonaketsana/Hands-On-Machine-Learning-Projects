# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository is guided by the book called hands-on-ML [Hands-on-Machine Learning (PDF)](https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=41&q=Hands-on-Machine-Learning+(1).pdf&cvid=968805ac36bf47619def6f98aa92e581&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgYIAhBFGDzSAQgyMDA3ajBqMagCALACAA&FORM=ANNTA1&ucpdpc=UCPD&adppc=EDGEESS&PC=DCTS)

###

Each project has its description written on Overview

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/topollonaketsana/Hands-On-Machine-Learning-Projects.git
```

##
Go to the project directory and start exploring the notebooks:

```bash
cd Hands-On-Machine-Learning-Projects
```

## Note
I have created the repository for Jupyter Lab ([here](https://github.com/topollonaketsana/JupyterLab.git)). This repository will guide you on how to download JupyterLab or how to create a Virtual Jupyter Notebook on your browser rather than downloading it.
