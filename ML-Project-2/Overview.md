### Project 1: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

In this project, we will go through the entire process of a machine learning project from start to finish. We will:

- Explore the data
- Prepare the data
- Select and train a model
- Fine-tune the model
- Present the solution

##
The accessible code is written on `Housing_src.ipynb` and can be run using the following bash lines:

1. After cloning the `main` repository, you move to this sub-directory:
```bash
cd ML-Project-1
```
2. Download Jupyter Lab (or see instructions on my other repository):
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

3. Run the code 
```bash
jupyter lab Housing_src.ipynb

```

## The file will open directly from the jupyter lab
